# ShippingApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.9.
Build a package tracking system similar to Armex or Bosta. This system would facilitate business owners who sell products through platforms like Facebook or Instagram. After receiving an order, the business owner can hand over the package to a delivery courier along with the delivery fee and the customer’s address. The courier then communicates with the customer to arrange the delivery of the package.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
